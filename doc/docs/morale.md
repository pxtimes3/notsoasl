### Morale

A value between 1-100 representing how willing a soldier is to follow orders. 

Soldiers with low experience (see conscript) start out with 70 morale points. Experienced, Veteran and Elite are 80, 90 and 100 respectively. 

Different events degrade morale until the soldier deserts (value under 10 + a morale test). A soldier not under any morale degrading events increases their morale by - their leaders experience level points - per minute. Unit leaders can use one of their [rally points](glossary.md#rally-pool) to raise the morale with 20 points for all soldiers in a unit. 

#### Leader experience

2, 4, 6, 8 depending on their experience. Usually the same as the rest of the unit.


#### Morale tests

A soldier with a morale value under 50 has to take a test every turn. If that fails the soldier is considered **broken**. Broken soldiers will need to pass a morale test (taken every turn) in order to follow their current order.

Ex.

A USGI Rifle Squad is under fire and their morale values have degraded to 40. One rifleman, Kenny, rolls a 43 on his morale test and is now considered **broken**. The unit is ordered to advance to a point this turn, so Kenny has to roll again. This time he rolls a 61 and will not advance with the rest of his unit. The next turn he rolls 23 on his morale test and is now not broken anymore and tries to advance with (or towards) his unit. This may lead to soldiers becoming **stragglers**.

#### The effect of morale on orders

Once a soldier has a morale rating of less than 50 a mo
